# Installation

You can install tarifa on windows, macosx or linux. You need a working
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/) environment.
It is recommended to install node via [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

Depending on your host, you will be able to support the following platforms:

| platform/os                                | macosx | linux | win32 |
| -------------------------------------------|:------:|:-----:|:-----:|
| [ios](http://developer.apple.com/)         | ✔      | ✗     | ✗     |
| [android](http://developer.android.com/)   | ✔      | ✔     | ✔     |
| [windows phone](http://dev.windows.com/en-us/develop/download-phone-sdk) | ✗      | ✗     | ✔     |

You need to install the proper SDK in order to work with a given platform.

All OS need [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) for icons and splash screens generation.
tarifa needs [cupertino](https://github.com/nomad/cupertino) on macosx in order to manage mobile provisioning files and to communicate with
[developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com/).

On windows you'll have to ensure that the [PowerShell execution policy](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh847748.aspx)
is not set to `Restricted` nor `AllSigned`. A good value for tarifa is setting the policy to `RemoteSigned` for the
`CurrentUser` scope which can be achieved by running
`Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` as an administrator in some PowerShell.

When the SDKs are properly installed you can install tarifa with *npm*:

```
npm install -g tarifa
```

Some optional dependencies may fail depending on your OS
(e.g., cordova-deploy-windows-phone fails to install on linux or macosx).

Please note that the current version of tarifa is based on cordova 4.1.2, which builds android projects with Gradle.
Sadly enough you may encounter the following error when building an app for android: `File '<path-to-android-sdk>/tools/zipalign' specified for property 'zipAlignExe' does not exist.`.
If you've installed the `Android SDK Build-tools` that file does exist, but in the `<path-to-android-sdk>/build-tools/<version-of-installed-build-tools>` directory.
Make sure to copy that `zipalign` file in the `<path-to-android-sdk>/tools` directory prior to building an app for android.

Running [`tarifa info`](../usage/info.md) checks if all needed tools are available.
