# tarifa-book

tarifa is a CLI based on [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/).
It aims at simplifying the Apache Cordova workflow and adding features to complete cordova toolchain such as:

* **multiple configurations**: produce multiple unique apps easily on a given platform within a single project.
* **integration of any front-end build system**: integrate your build process in the cordova workflow.
* **interactive project bootstrap**: no need to remember every required information while creating a project, tarifa will guide you
with adequate questions and save the answers in the project files.
* **deployment to hockeyapp from the terminal**: no need to launch a browser to upload a binary file to hockeyapp, tarifa handles it.
