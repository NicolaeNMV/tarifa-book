# Configuration

In tarifa, a configuration is a json representation of the application settings
for a particular environment. It is described under the `configurations` key in
  the `tarifa.json` file.

When creating a tarifa project with `tarifa create`, tarifa will create the
following configurations: **_default_**, **_dev_**, **_stage_**, **_prod_**.

You can add or delete any configuration you like. The **_default_** configuration
allows to run tarifa commands without specifying any environment. For instance:

    $ tarifa run android

will use the **_default_** configuration to run the app, whereas

    $ tarifa run android dev

will use the **_dev_** configuration where you can have settings specific to
your dev environment.

By default, the **_stage_** environment is configured for hockeyapp deployments
(and ad-hoc distribution signing process on ios) as well, but you can change that.

These configurations are just naming conventions, you can add any configuration
you need and each one allows you to build a unique application.

### `tarifa.json`

The skeleton of a minimal `tarifa.json` file:

``` json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "id": "org.tarifa.demo",
  "description": "a simple app description",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "platforms": [
    "android",
    "web"
  ],
  "plugins": [
    "org.apache.cordova.splashscreen"
  ],
  "configurations": {
    "android": {
      "default": {
        "id": "org.tarifa.demo",
        "product_name": "demo",
        "product_file_name": "demo"
      }
    },
    "web": {
      "default": {
        "id": "org.tarifa.demo",
        "product_name": "demo",
        "product_file_name": "demo"
      }
    }
  },
  "cordova": {
    "preferences": {},
    "accessOrigin": []
  },
  "author": {}
}
```

#### attributes

##### name
It's the default app name, it the name used to create the cordova project on `tarifa create`. <span style="background:yellow;"><strong>FIXME</strong> Can't be changed right now.</span>

##### id
It's the default cordova id. <span style="background:yellow;"><strong>FIXME</strong> Can't be changed right now.</span>

##### description
It's a brief description of the app, it' will be replaced in the corodva `config.xml`

##### version
It's the version of the project and it's possible to overwrite it in every configuration. It must be a 3 digits style version number.
On windows phone and windows8, a 4 digits format is mandatory, so tarifa will append `0` to the given version to match the format.

##### platforms

It's a list of all available platforms in the tarifa project.

##### plugins

It's a list of all installed cordova plugins in the tarifa project.

##### configurations

It's a definition of all available configurations. While creating a project with `tarifa create`, tarifa will add 4 defaults configurations for each platforms you want: **_default_**, **_dev_**, **_stage_** and **_prod_**.

For example, on a project with only the web and the android platform, by default `configurations` should look like that:

```json
{
  "android": {
    "default": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.demo",
      "product_name": "demo",
      "product_file_name": "demo"
    },
    "dev": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.dev",
      "product_name": "demo dev",
      "product_file_name": "demo-dev"
    },
    "stage": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.stage",
      "product_name": "demo stage",
      "product_file_name": "demo-stage"
    },
    "prod": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.prod",
      "product_name": "demo prod",
      "product_file_name": "demo-prod"
    }
  },
  "web": {
    "default": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.demo",
      "product_name": "demo",
      "product_file_name": "demo"
    },
    "dev": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.dev",
      "product_name": "demo dev",
      "product_file_name": "demo-dev"
    },
    "stage": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.stage",
      "product_name": "demo stage",
      "product_file_name": "demo-stage"
    },
    "prod": {
      "id": "org.tarifa.prod",
      "product_name": "demo prod",
      "product_file_name": "demo-prod"
    }
  }
}
```

Each platforms have a set of configurations name with and a minimum of 3
attributes:

* `id` which allows to overwrite the default cordova app `id`
* `product_name` which allows to overwrite the name of the app, the one you read on your device screen
* `product_file_name` which allows to specify the name of the generated binary (in the case of android an .apk file)

##### cordova

It contains a `preferences` attributes allowing to overwrite any cordova `config.xml` preferences and a `accessOrigin` attributes.
By default `tarifa create` will generate the content of the `cordova` attribute like that:

##### author

The `author` defines the following properties:

```json
{
  "name": "your name",
  "email": "me@tarifa.tools",
  "href": "http://tarifa.tools"
}
```


### `private.json`

The `private.json` contains all configurations informations that you don't want
to expose in a source control software.

For instance you can use it to set the path to your Android keystore (needed to
sign apps for release):

``` json
{
  "configurations": {
    "android": {
      "prod": {
        "keystore_path": "/path/to/my/key.keystore",
        "keystore_alias": "myalias"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Defining `keystore_path` and `keystore_alias` in a configuration tells tarifa to
compile this android configuration in release mode and to sign it with
the given key alias and key store.
